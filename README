# Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices based on property features using supervised machine learning techniques.

The goal is to analyze property characteristics and build a regression model capable of estimating market prices.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Accurate real estate price prediction is important for buyers, sellers, and investors.  
This project applies machine learning algorithms to estimate housing prices based on features such as:

- Size (square meters)
- Number of rooms
- Location
- Year built
- Additional property characteristics

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (if you used it)

---

## 🔎 Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature selection and normalization
3. Model training using regression algorithms
4. Model evaluation using metrics such as:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score

---

## 📊 Results
The model demonstrates the ability to capture relationships between property features and housing prices, achieving reasonable predictive accuracy.
